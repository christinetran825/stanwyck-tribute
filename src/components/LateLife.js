          <p>For her work in <span className="film-name">“Stella Dallas”</span> (1937), <span className="film-name">“Ball of Fire”</span> (1941), <span className="film-name">“Double Indemnity”</span> (1944), and <span className="film-name">“Sorry, Wrong Number”</span> (1948), she was nominated for best-actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, she won neither of them. However, in 1982, the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for her body of work. Modest in her acceptance speech, she thanked all the people behind the scenes who made the films for what they were and for making her look great.

          <p>In January 20, 1990, Barbara passed away of congestive heart failure. Upon her wishes, there were no burials at her funeral. Instead, her ashes were scattered over Lone Pine, California where dozens of Hollywood Westerns were made. She was one of the greatest actresses of Hollywood’s studio era. She appeared in both movies and television and had successes during The Pre-Code Era and The Golden Age of Hollywood. She was easygoing and never allowed her star quality get to her head. Her early formative years certainly prepared her for life both on and off screen playing self-assured women knowing what they want and doing what it’ll take to get it.

          <h3 className="quote">“…the actress in control, the very essence of Barbara Stanwyck’s imminent. That hold she has in the audience is reality, she’s professional. When she walks across the screen, it’s beauty and confidence, she’s always the woman that she plays, and yet always herself.”</h3>
