            <p>Maybe it’s just me, but when watching any of Stany’s (or Missy, as many have nicknamed her) films, I can see myself in her characters. Stany made me believe I could be her characters, the good and the bad. Her performances were raw, honest. She was the everyday women - flaws, perfection, insecurity, authentic, generous, career-driven, professional, and full of integrity and independent spirit. The characteristic traits she forged from every role weren’t too far away from her true self. It was well known that she was as real as it gets; or how today’s society calls it, “keeping it 100.” While most Hollywood actors at the time were trained to speak in a “sophisticated Mid Atlantic” accent, she kept her natural Brooklyn accent throughout her films. She was named the highest earning woman in America in 1944 at $400,0000. Today, that’s about $5.6 million. Her name may have even sparked the popularity of naming young girls “Barbara” in 1942. Stories and testimonials shed light on her reputation from directors like Frank Capra, Fritz Lang, and Preston Sturges almost unanimously praising her. The director Cecil B. DeMille, once wrote, “I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.’’</p>
            <p>She admired regular working folks, making an effort getting to know the crew members from their names to their life. She treated people with respect and kindness while fighting for her beliefs. An unknown actor at the time, William Holden was cast as the leading role in the 1939 film, Golden Boy. Barbara fought hard to keep him cast and guided him on his acting journey that year. His gratitude lasted for years to come developing into a lifelong friendship. At the 50th Academy Awards, while presenting an award, Holden publicly thanked her for all she did for him.</p>

            <p>For her work in <span className="film-name">“Stella Dallas”</span> (1937), <span className="film-name">“Ball of Fire”</span> (1941), <span className="film-name">“Double Indemnity”</span> (1944), and <span className="film-name">“Sorry, Wrong Number”</span> (1948), she was nominated for best-actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, she won neither of them. However, in 1982, the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for her body of work. Modest in her acceptance speech, she thanked all the people behind the scenes who made the films for what they were and for making her look great. As her closing statement, she mentioned her friend William Holden who had passed earlier in the year, and said, “He always wished that I would get an Oscar and so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish!”</p>

            <p>As is Hollywood, when actresses reached a certain age, movie roles were hard to come by. In response, Barbara moved over to television. She had her own tv series in 1961, The Barbara Stanwyck Show. Though not a success she earned an Emmy Award. She played the matriarch Victoria Barkley in the Western series, “The Big Valley.” The show lasted five seasons and garnered her another Emmy. Her third Emmy was awarded for her 1983 role as Mary Carson in another Western hit series called The Thorn Birds.</p>

            <p>In January 20, 1990, Barbara passed away of congestive heart failure. Upon her wishes, there were no burials at her funeral. Instead, her ashes were scattered over Lone Pine, California where dozens of Hollywood Westerns were made. She was one of the greatest actresses of Hollywood’s studio era. She appeared in both movies and television and had successes during The Pre-Code Era and The Golden Age of Hollywood. She was easygoing and never allowed her star quality get to her head. Her early formative years certainly prepared her for life both on and off screen playing self-assured women knowing what they want and doing what it’ll take to get it. At the 1982 Oscars, John Travolta summed her best...</p>

          <h3 className="quote">“…the actress in control, the very essence of Barbara Stanwyck’s imminent. That hold she has in the audience is reality, she’s professional. When she walks across the screen, it’s beauty and confidence, she’s always the woman that she plays, and yet always herself.”</h3>
