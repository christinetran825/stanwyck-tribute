            <p>In the 1920s the movie industry welcomed sound. With it came the awe and captivation of movie stars. They were idolized and aspired to. Women stars were portrayed as virgins, saints, sinners, vamps, innocent, and sometimes unsophisticated. Gone were the days of purity. The 20s arrived with open arms where films were racy, outspoken, fresh, sometimes raunchy, escapisms, and brutally honest. This new tone marked a time where women dominated the film industry. On screen, the women sought and made their voices heard. They got rid of unfaithful husbands and held professional positions without apologizing. Some were involved in the underbelly of organized crimes. They explored their sexuality having many lovers, having premarital sex, and at times had children out of wedlock. Women were rebels, sensual, powerful, and independent. They were the modern women making tough decisions be it out of necessity or out of personal drive. The path could be considered the wrong way but it was her way and she’ll do what it takes to survive. If men could do it, then so can women too. Perhaps it was the early birth of feminism in film during an era when it was least expected.</p>

            <p>Barbara’s Pre-Code films highly embodied those sentiments. Her characters were usually down-trotted women who work their way up through any necessary means; even if it meant using her own body. Despite the backstories, her characters reflected the wit, intelligence, grit, fight, and power a woman holds. Their strength in themselves and overall self-reliance proved just how confident and smart women were even when they’re suffocated by their situation and environments. At times, her characters will need to adopt masculine traits or values to survive.</p>

            <h4 className="article-title">Honorable Mentions</h4>
            <p>In <span className="film-name">“Ladies They Talk About”</span>, Barbara’s character was the mastermind behind a bank robbery during the Great Depression. Her performance as a calculative and impressionable Nan shows how even some women can’t get away with playing the helpless poor girl card.</p>
            <p>In the memorable <span className="film-name">“Baby Face”</span>, Barbara’s character Lilly, comes from an awful background, sexually exploited by her very own father. She fights her way out of that life by playing the helpless, innocent woman as she targets successful, older, wealthy, young, and ignorant men. She manipulates them into believing they’re in charge. Sleeping her way up to the top and getting what she wants without apologies, without showing little remorse towards morality from this character was viewed as a little too natural. Her performance seemed to have projected an idea where the everyday woman could sleep her way up to the top. </p>
            <p>Another film called <span className="film-name">“Night Nurse”</span> featured Barbara in lingerie as she undresses herself for bed. A scene in the film includes our hero being knocked unconscious after an attempted rape. The bootlegger is the hero and the chauffeur is the villain. Barbara’s nurse character is in danger of saving the children she’s caring for who are being starved and targeted for murder. On a more positive note, a maternity ward scene showcased a diverse set of women of varying ethnic backgrounds as mothers receiving their newborn babies. Night Nurse showed us a character who sought to do the moral deed of helping others but stuck in between the rules and regulations. In the end, it seems as though sliding into the amoral side proved to be the moral thing to do.</p>

          <article className="precode">
            <p>As usual, these Pre-Code films and their tone were controversial to religious groups and those who preferred upholding public virtue. On screen, women were exhibiting dangerous behavior where everyday women could imitate and men would accept. Will Hays became the film industry’s spokesman whose duty was to limit government censorship. Hays developed a list of rules of behaviors but many studios didn’t always follow through. In 1933, Joseph Breen who was in charge of public relations for the Hays office began to infiltrate his beliefs of moral code and common decency into the film industry and Hollywood. He believed Hollywood was truly immoral and sought to change its ways using his connection to his religious circle. Breen and his religious group’s goal was to try and clean up “indecency” from movies. These religious leaders created their own version of a movie rating, condemning those who did not follow their heed. One could consider it an extreme case of censorship. Everything from profanity, drug use, childbirth, and interracial relationships were removed or ‘modified’ to meet code regulations. In a way, the Hays Code fought to portray a world of happy endings reflecting puritanical policies for the next 30 years.</p>

            <p>The code looks to have suppressed female empowerment, independence, free spiritism, and many of the freedoms of the female self defined during the Pre-Code era. Virginity and purity had returned subjecting women back into the kitchen to fulfill her motherly and housewife duties to uphold the virtues of ‘common decency.’</p>

            <p>Ironically, the staunchly conservative Barbara would become a member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. She believed that “hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American Way.” The group supported the blacklisting House Committee on Un-American Activities opposing both communist and fascist influences in Hollywood. That’s a story for another time.</p>

            <p>The Pre-Code era didn't affect Barbara's shining star as it did for a few other actresses at the time. Over her 38-year motion picture career, Barbara made 85 films playing a mix of characters usually of women from humble origins who had to fight to earn their rightful place in society. She continued to be a versatile actress starring in a long diverse list of films from comedies, noir, thrillers, and Westerns. Like a panther, she cooly and calculatively played a slutty, gold-digging scammer working her way up in social and financial status <span className="film-name">(Baby Face)</span>, a sleazy murderous blonde <span className="film-name">(Double Indemnity)</span>, a witty con artist pulling a fast one <span className="film-name">(The Lady Eve)</span>, and a slang-tongue screwball heroine in a sort of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs comedy way <span className="film-name">(Ball of Fire)</span>. Whatever the role, whatever genre, Barbara gave it her all, and usually on one take.</p>

            <p>She developed a distinctive character image - thick skin exterior shielding a warm, soft heart. Her emotional range was incredible. Expressing the exploration of human behavior and all its complexities was one of Barbara’s strengths not just as a performer. It might’ve been a cathartic outlet as she dug deep within her own life and experiences to bring intense complexity to her characters. Portraying a self-reliant, gutsy, and incredibly confident woman whose cool exterior held a vulnerable woman with a genuine heart defined a majority of roles she’s played. She believed writers then paid more attention to actors and actresses. Writers used to look at the actors and actresses work to build on the characters. Knowing the resume allowed writers to “know a part of you.” This was apparent in the film <span className="film-name">“Stella Dallas.”</span> Stella was a tough-talking woman but self-sacrificing noble mother. Speaking about the role, Barbara said, "...She wasn't me, that woman, but she was a woman I understood completely. She was good, cheap but good, and I could play her.” This 1937 remake of the original film was highly acclaimed and well received adding even more shine to Barbara’s star. The film was so popular a radio soap opera was created to continue the story from the film. It lasted for two decades. Stella Dallas is one of Barbara's most well-known role earning her an Academy Award Nomination.</p>
